# These options add classes that implement the ChangeListener interface. There are
# two associations a class can have: user and path.
#
# The user type associates a ChangeListener to use for a particular user, when
# that user's Reviews specification matches the changelist. The format for the
# user option is:
#   <userid>:<class>[,<userid>:<class>+]
#
# The default ChangeListener will be called on every changelist, but the list
# of users reviewing the change will be reduced by any users that have specific
# classes associated with them.
#
# The path type associates a ChangeListener with a depot path in perforce. This
# path can contain wildcards. When the path matches any file in a changelist, the
# class is called for that changelist. The format for the path option is:
#   <path>:<class>[,<path>:<class>+]
#
# All matches are determined prior to any ChangeListener being called on a
# changelist. This allows for a class to match in multiple ways but only be called
# once per changelist.
#
# If the classes listed are not found, a warning will be generated. The reviewer
# will continue to function, but without that class loaded.
#
# The following lines are examples of how these classes are specified. The first
# line specifies specific classes for users perforce and gomer. The second line
# specifies a specific class that will be called for any change list that has
# a .java file in it.
